# arraylistLab3
I decided to use the arraylist 

In our third lab of the semester we will create a Java CLI application that enables a manager to enter up to 20 salespeople’s names, IDs and annual sales. Each salesperson should be an object.
The manager can choose to add, delete, or change the sales in a salesperson object. After each option, display the list sorted by ID or name (ascending) and request the next action (add, delete, change, or quit). Lab Parameters
We need to use two separate exercises for our lab. To create the object
Exercise 6A on pages 433-434
class use the first half of  of the 
textbook. Make sure to add the salesperson’s name. You only need the 
information on constructing the Salesperson class not the DemoSalesperson application in this exercise.
After creating the Salesperson class, use Exercise 5 on page 485 of the textbook to create your application class. All parameters and logic in this section should be included. Make sure to allow for input of the salesperson’s name as well.
Please note that there is no actual database for this lab even though the exercise says to “pretend” it’s a database. We are working with arrays and no data will be stored between application runs. Do not use a database.
Your two classes should be:
Lab3classID.java
Your main application class. The logic noted in Exercise 5 (Chapter 9) should be included here. Remember that the application class controls the program’s logic.
Salesperson.java
Your class used to create each of the 20 potential salesperson objects.
Each contains a name, ID, and annual sales. This is from Exercise 6A (Chapter 8).

Make sure to add ASCII design and include your company’s name and other
important information in the output.	
Challenge Parameters
For those who want to create a more robust application, consider the following in this order. Please note that there is only one GUI option for this lab:
1.Allow the manager to choose when to display the sorted list rather than always showing it after each action.
2.Allow the manager to always choose which item should be sorted and in what order (ascending versus descending) before displaying the list.
3.GUI Option: Create one form that enables the manager to add, delete, or change anything in a salesperson object as well as choose the sort options. Another form can be used for output. (Much is in chapters 14-16.)
Important items to note
•	Use NetBeans for this lab and turn in the project folder
•	Follow variable and file naming conventions
•	Use appropriate data types
•	Document every file that you create and/or change
•	Include your classID as appropriate
Deliverables
This lab (entire project folder) should be turned in as a .zip file named with your Lab number and classID. For example, if your classID was bjones4242 (Bubba Jones), the file would be: 
Lab3bjones4242.zip
Refer to the Documentation Guide at for guidance on comments and lab preparation.
When you are finished, make sure to upload AND submit your lab in eLearning.
